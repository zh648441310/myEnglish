　　How to Become a Successful Speaker of English



　　Some students of ten say "My spoken English is poor." Other s say "Speaking English is veryhard for me, so no need to try." T his is what we call "negative thinking." In fact, a lot ofChinese students can speak good English, but they don't. Their problem is a linguisticinferiority complex, in other words, they worry that they won't be able to speak as well asother people, so they feel infe rior in their presence. This sickness has a cure, that is, buildingself-confidence to get rid of shyness.

　　Here are some suggestions for you .

　　The first thing you can do is to speak English with good friends, with whom you can speak freely without feeling shy. Then, try your ability with teachers and foreigners if possible. Don'tbe afraid of mistakes and don't be afraid to ask questions about things you don't know, as thisis the way to acquire knowledge.

　　Thirdly, try to think in English and leave out mind translation. Not until you have done so canyou be said to have a bet ter command of spoken English.

　　Fourthly, do more reading to expand vocabulary and learn to use the new words in your speechas much as possible.

　　Lastly, don't get angry with your self when you come across something you cannot express inEnglish or the words you want to use suddenly escape your memory. This is unavoidable inthe learning process. Just keep constant practice. For example, in CET-SET, a number ofcandidates failed the first time and after half a year's practice, they succeeded in the secondround.

　　To sum up, just as the old proverb says "Where there is a will , there is a way," so no one should convince himself that he can't do what other people have done. Erase the negativenotion and maintain a positive attitude. There in lies success. By then you can communicate with the world.

Cultivate Your Reading Habit

　　如何培养阅读习惯

　　We may say with certainty that the more one reads, the better one understands ; and that the better one understands, the more one is inclined to read. In other words, from reading comesunderstanding, and from understanding comes more reading. The reading habit is actuallycultivated by reading itself.

　　Now let us discuss the question of what to read. There are books on various subjects — history, literature, philosophy, science, fine arts, etc. When you a re to choose from among a vastnumber of subjects the best books to read, you will feel quite at sea. I therefore suggest that, before you proceed to read any book, you try to find out what others have done before you, that is read the results of other people's labour first. Usually newspapers or magazines arealways your convenient guide to the world of best writings.

　　Another problem is how to read. Here, I would offer two suggestions: concent ration andreflection. You cannot well unde rstand what is said in book s unless you concent rate yourmind on what you read. And then you must think over what you have read. This is reflectionwhich helps to s ummarize your reading . To a great extent , concentration and reflectionare interdependent.

　　A reading habit thus formed will prove valuable to you. Whenever you have spare time, youwill resort not to places of pleasure, but to the bookshelves, you will not feel lonesome whenyou are alone, because you can see all kinds of characters moving and acting on the pages, andyou can hear all kinds of good counsel. In the long run, your imaginative power will beincreased, your esthetic sensibility heightened, your vocabulary enlarged, and finally your ability ofwriting tremendously improved.
